# Chapter 6 - Exercises

Use these exercises to put into practice the knowledge you have gained from chapter 6. You can save your solutions to the exercises to this repository and it is recommended that for each exercise you create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to the relevant exercise folder for the chapter you are working on. Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push the code to your remote repository on GitHub.

### 1. Woof Woof

Write a program that declares a class which defines the characteristics of a dog. The program should instantiate two objects from this class and assign data to its members. Once these dog objects have been created output their details to the console

### 2. Playing around in class

Use this exercise to play around with creating and accessing class members and methods. Your members and methods should be specified as public and you should try out the following:

* Create a class called Animal
  * Give the class at least the following members
    * Type
    * Name
    * Colour
    * Age
    * Weight
    * Noise
  * The class should have the following methods
    * sayHello (says its name via ```cout```)
    * makeNoise (make an appropriate noise via ```cout```)
    * animalDetails (output all the details of the animal object)
* Instantiate at least two objects from your animal class (e.g. Dog, Cow)
  * Set values for each of the variables
  * Invoke each of the class functions
* Add a default constructor (e.g. without parameters) that provides a message to say an animal has been created
* Add a destructor that provides a message to say when an animal is deleted
* Add a constructor with parameters to set initial values for at least two of your object's variables (e.g. name and noise)
* Instantiate an object from your class that makes use of the parameterized constructor to set some initial values
* Organise your class to make use of a .cpp and .h file

&nbsp;

### 3. Data Class

Create a class called data. The class should contain two integer variables, a constructor that accepts values for these variables and a function that returns the sum of these variables.

With the class defined, ask the user of the program to input two numbers. Pass these values to the class constructor and show the result of the sum of the two numbers.

#### Extension Problems

* Prevent invalid data being entered
* Declare and define the class functions and constructor separately
* Organise your class to make use of a .cpp and .h file
